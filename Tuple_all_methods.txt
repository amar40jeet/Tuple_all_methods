# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# 1. count(): Count the number of occurrences of a specified element
count_of_2 = my_tuple.count(2)
print("Count of 2:", count_of_2)  # Output: 1

# 2. index(): Find the index of the first occurrence of a specified element
index_of_4 = my_tuple.index(4)
print("Index of 4:", index_of_4)  # Output: 3

# 3. len(): Get the length of the tuple (not a method, but a built-in function)
length_of_tuple = len(my_tuple)
print("Length of tuple:", length_of_tuple)  # Output: 5

# 4. Accessing elements (not a method, but useful to demonstrate tuple operations)
first_element = my_tuple[0]
last_element = my_tuple[-1]
print("First element:", first_element)  # Output: 1
print("Last element:", last_element)    # Output: 5

# 5. Slicing (not a method, but useful to demonstrate tuple operations)
sub_tuple = my_tuple[1:4]
print("Sliced tuple (1:4):", sub_tuple)  # Output: (2, 3, 4)
